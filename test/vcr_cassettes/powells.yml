        no sign at all that another boy lived in the house, too. Yet Harry Potter
        was still there, asleep at the moment, but not for long. His Aunt Petunia
        was awake and it was her shrill voice that made the first noise of the day.
        &lt;P&gt; &quot;Up! Get up! Now!&quot; &lt;P&gt; Harry woke with a start.
        His aunt rapped on the door again. &lt;P&gt; &quot;Up!&quot; she screeched.
        Harry heard her walking toward the kitchen and then the sound of the frying
        pan being put on the stove. He rolled onto his back and tried to remember
        the dream he had been having. It had been a good one. There had been a flying
        motorcycle in it. He had a funny feeling he''d had the same dream before.
        &lt;P&gt; His aunt was back outside the door. &lt;P&gt; &quot;Are you up yet?&quot;
        she demanded. &lt;P&gt; &quot;Nearly,&quot; said Harry. &lt;P&gt; &quot;Well,
        get a move on, I want you to look after the bacon. And don''t you dare let
        it burn, I want everything perfect on Duddy''s birthday.&quot; &lt;P&gt; Harry
        groaned. &lt;P&gt; &quot;What did you say?&quot; his aunt snapped through
        the door. &lt;P&gt; &quot;Nothing, nothing . . .&quot; &lt;P&gt; Dudley''s
        birthday ? how could he have forgotten? Harry got slowly out of bed and started
        looking for socks. He found a pair under his bed and, after pulling a spider
        off one of them, put them on. Harry was used to spiders, because the cupboard
        under the stairs was full of them, and that was where he slept. &lt;P&gt;
        When he was dressed he went down the hall into the kitchen. The table was
        almost hidden beneath all Dudley''s birthday presents. It looked as though
        Dudley had gotten the new computer he wanted, not to mention the second television
        and the racing bike. Exactly why Dudley wanted a racing bike was a mystery
        to Harry, as Dudley was very fat and hated exercise ? unless of course it
        involved punching somebody. Dudley''s favorite punching bag was Harry, but
        he couldn''t often catch him. Harry didn''t look it, but he was very fast.
        &lt;P&gt; Perhaps it had something to do with living in a dark cupboard, but
        Harry had always been small and skinny for his age. He looked even smaller
        and skinnier than he really was because all he had to wear were old clothes
        of Dudley''s, and Dudley was about four times bigger than he was. Harry had
        a thin face, knobbly knees, black hair, and bright green eyes. He wore round
        glasses held together with a lot of Scotch tape because of all the times Dudley
        had punched him on the nose. The only thing Harry liked about his own appearance
        was a very thin scar on his forehead that was shaped like a bolt of lightning.
        He had had it as long as he could remember, and the first question he could
        ever remember asking his Aunt Petunia was how he had gotten it. &lt;P&gt;
        &quot;In the car crash when your parents died,&quot; she had said. &quot;And
        don''t ask questions.&quot; &lt;P&gt; Don''t ask questions ? that was the
        first rule for a quiet life with the Dursleys. &lt;P&gt; Uncle Vernon entered
        the kitchen as Harry was turning over the bacon. &lt;P&gt; &quot;Comb your
        hair!&quot; he barked, by way of a morning greeting. &lt;P&gt; About once
        a week, Uncle Vernon looked over the top of his newspaper and shouted that
        Harry needed a haircut. Harry must have had more haircuts than the rest of
        the boys in his class put together, but it made no difference, his hair simply
        grew that way ? all over the place. &lt;P&gt; Harry was frying eggs by the
        time Dudley arrived in the kitchen with his mother. Dudley looked a lot like
        Uncle Vernon. He had a large pink face, not much neck, small, watery blue
        eyes, and thick blond hair that lay smoothly on his thick, fat head. Aunt
        Petunia often said that Dudley looked like a baby angel ? Harry often said
        that Dudley looked like a pig in a wig. &lt;P&gt; Harry put the plates of
        egg and bacon on the table, which was difficult as there wasn''t much room.
        Dudley, meanwhile, was counting his presents. His face fell. &lt;P&gt; &quot;Thirty-six,&quot;
        he said, looking up at his mother and father. &quot;That''s two less than
        last year.&quot; &lt;P&gt; &quot;Darling, you haven''t counted Auntie Marge''s
        present, see, it''s here under this big one from Mommy and Daddy.&quot; &lt;P&gt;
        &quot;All right, thirty-seven then,&quot; said Dudley, going red in the face.
        Harry, who could see a huge Dudley tantrum coming on, began wolfing down his
        bacon as fast as possible in case Dudley turned the table over. &lt;P&gt;
        Aunt Petunia obviously scented danger, too, because she said quickly, &quot;And
        we''ll buy you another two presents while we''re out today. How''s that, popkin?
        Two more presents. Is that all right?&quot; &lt;P&gt; Dudley thought for a
        moment. It looked like hard work. Finally he said slowly, &quot;So I''ll have
        thirty . . . thirty . . .&quot; &lt;P&gt; &quot;Thirty-nine, sweetums,&quot;
        said Aunt Petunia. &lt;P&gt; &quot;Oh.&quot; Dudley sat down heavily and grabbed
        the nearest parcel. &quot;All right then.&quot; &lt;P&gt; Uncle Vernon chuckled.
        &lt;P&gt; &quot;Little tyke wants his money''s worth, just like his father.
        ''Atta boy, Dudley!&quot; He ruffled Dudley''s hair. &lt;P&gt; At that moment
        the telephone rang and Aunt Petunia went to answer it while Harry and Uncle
        Vernon watched Dudley unwrap the racing bike, a video camera, a remote control
        airplane, sixteen new computer games, and a VCR. He was ripping the paper
        off a gold wristwatch when Aunt Petunia came back from the telephone looking
        both angry and worried. &lt;P&gt; &quot;Bad news, Vernon,&quot; she said.
        &quot;Mrs. Figg''s broken her leg. She can''t take him.&quot; She jerked her
        head in Harry''s direction. &lt;P&gt; Dudley''s mouth fell open in horror,
        but Harry''s heart gave a leap. Every year on Dudley''s birthday, his parents
        took him and a friend out for the day, to adventure parks, hamburger restaurants,
        or the movies. Every year, Harry was left behind with Mrs. Figg, a mad old
        lady who lived two streets away. Harry hated it there. The whole house smelled
        of cabbage and Mrs. Figg made him look at photographs of all the cats she''d
        ever owned. &lt;P&gt; &quot;Now what?&quot; said Aunt Petunia, looking furiously
        at Harry as though he''d planned this. Harry knew he ought to feel sorry that
        Mrs. Figg had broken her leg, but it wasn''t easy when he reminded himself
        it would be a whole year before he had to look at Tibbles, Snowy, Mr. Paws,
        and Tufty again. &lt;P&gt; &quot;We could phone Marge,&quot; Uncle Vernon
        suggested. &lt;P&gt; &quot;Don''t be silly, Vernon, she hates the boy.&quot;
        &lt;P&gt; The Dursleys often spoke about Harry like this, as though he wasn''t
        there ? or rather, as though he was something very nasty that couldn''t understand
        them, like a slug. &lt;P&gt; &quot;What about what''s-her-name, your friend
        ? Yvonne?&quot; &lt;P&gt; &quot;On vacation in Majorca,&quot; snapped Aunt
        Petunia. &lt;P&gt; &quot;You could just leave me here,&quot; Harry put in
        hopefully (he''d be able to watch what he wanted on television for a change
        and maybe even have a go on Dudley''s computer). &lt;P&gt; Aunt Petunia looked
        as though she''d just swallowed a lemon. &lt;P&gt; &quot;And come back and
        find the house in ruins?&quot; she snarled. &lt;P&gt; &quot;I won''t blow
        up the house,&quot; said Harry, but they weren''t listening. &lt;P&gt; &quot;I
        suppose we could take him to the zoo,&quot; said Aunt Petunia slowly, &quot;.
        . . and leave him in the car. . . .&quot; &lt;P&gt; &quot;That car''s new,
        he''s not sitting in it alone. . . .&quot; &lt;P&gt; Dudley began to cry loudly.
        In fact, he wasn''t really crying ? it had been years since he''d really cried
        ? but he knew that if he screwed up his face and wailed, his mother would
        give him anything he wanted. &lt;P&gt; &quot;Dinky Duddydums, don''t cry,
        Mummy won''t let him spoil your special day!&quot; she cried, flinging her
        arms around him. &lt;P&gt; &quot;I . . . don''t . . . want . . . him . . .
        t-t-to come!&quot; Dudley yelled between huge, pretend sobs. &quot;He always
        sp-spoils everything!&quot; He shot Harry a nasty grin through the gap in
        his mother''s arms. &lt;P&gt; Just then, the doorbell rang ? &quot;Oh, good
        Lord, they''re here!&quot; said Aunt Petunia frantically ? and a moment later,
        Dudley''s best friend, Piers Polkiss, walked in with his mother. Piers was
        a scrawny boy with a face like a rat. He was usually the one who held people''s
        arms behind their backs while Dudley hit them. Dudley stopped pretending to
        cry at once. &lt;P&gt; Half an hour later, Harry, who couldn''t believe his
        luck, was sitting in the back of the Dursleys'' car with Piers and Dudley,
        on the way to the zoo for the first time in his life. His aunt and uncle hadn''t
        been able to think of anything else to do with him, but before they''d left,
        Uncle Vernon had taken Harry aside. &lt;P&gt; &quot;I''m warning you,&quot;
        he had said, putting his large purple face right up close to Harry''s, &quot;I''m
        warning you now, boy ? any funny business, anything at all ? and you''ll be
        in that cupboard from now until Christmas.&quot; &lt;P&gt; &quot;I''m not
        going to do anything,&quot; said Harry, &quot;honestly . . .&quot; &lt;P&gt;
        But Uncle Vernon didn''t believe him. No one ever did. &lt;P&gt; The problem
        was, strange things often happened around Harry and it was just no good telling
        the Dursleys he didn''t make them happen. &lt;P&gt; Once, Aunt Petunia, tired
        of Harry coming back from the barbers looking as though he hadn''t been at
        all, had taken a pair of kitchen scissors and cut his hair so short he was
        almost bald except for his bangs, which she left &quot;to hide that horrible
        scar.&quot; Dudley had laughed himself silly at Harry, who spent a sleepless
        night imagining school the next day, where he was already laughed at for his
        baggy clothes and taped glasses. Next morning, however, he had gotten up to
        find his hair exactly as it had been before Aunt Petunia had sheared it off.
        He had been given a week in his cupboard for this, even though he had tried
        to explain that he couldn''t explain how it had grown back so quickly. &lt;P&gt;
        Another time, Aunt Petunia had been trying to force him into a revolting old
        sweater of Dudley''s (brown with orange puff balls). The harder she tried
        to pull it over his head, the smaller it seemed to become, until finally it
        might have fitted a hand puppet, but certainly wouldn''t fit Harry. Aunt Petunia
        had decided it must have shrunk in the wash and, to his great relief, Harry
        wasn''t punished. &lt;P&gt; On the other hand, he''d gotten into terrible
        trouble for being found on the roof of the school kitchens. Dudley''s gang
        had been chasing him as usual when, as much to Harry''s surprise as anyone
        else''s, there he was sitting on the chimney. The Dursleys had received a
        very angry letter from Harry''s headmistress telling them Harry had been climbing
        school buildings. But all he''d tried to do (as he shouted at Uncle Vernon
        through the locked door of his cupboard) was jump behind the big trash cans
        outside the kitchen doors. Harry supposed that the wind must have caught him
        in mid-jump. &lt;P&gt; But today, nothing was going to go wrong. It was even
        worth being with Dudley and Piers to be spending the day somewhere that wasn''t
        school, his cupboard, or Mrs. Figg''s cabbage-smelling living room. &lt;P&gt;
        While he drove, Uncle Vernon complained to Aunt Petunia. He liked to complain
        about things: people at work, Harry, the council, Harry, the bank, and Harry
        were just a few of his favorite subjects. This morning, it was motorcycles.
        &lt;P&gt; &quot;. . . roaring along like maniacs, the young hoodlums,&quot;
        he said, as a motorcycle overtook them. &lt;P&gt; &quot;I had a dream about
        a motorcycle,&quot; said Harry, remembering suddenly. &quot;It was flying.&quot;
        &lt;P&gt; Uncle Vernon nearly crashed into the car in front. He turned right
        around in his seat and yelled at Harry, his face like a gigantic beet with
        a mustache: &quot;MOTORCYCLES DON''T FLY!&quot; &lt;P&gt; Dudley and Piers
        sniggered. &lt;P&gt; &quot;I know they don''t,&quot; said Harry. &quot;It
        was only a dream.&quot; &lt;P&gt; But he wished he hadn''t said anything.
        If there was one thing the Dursleys hated even more than his asking questions,
        it was his talking about anything acting in a way it shouldn''t, no matter
        if it was in a dream or even a cartoon ? they seemed to think he might get
        dangerous ideas. &lt;P&gt; It was a very sunny Saturday and the zoo was crowded
        with families. The Dursleys bought Dudley and Piers large chocolate ice creams
        at the entrance and then, because the smiling lady in the van had asked Harry
        what he wanted before they could hurry him away, they bought him a cheap lemon
        ice pop. It wasn''t bad, either, Harry thought, licking it as they watched
        a gorilla scratching its head who looked remarkably like Dudley, except that
        it wasn''t blond. &lt;P&gt; Harry had the best morning he''d had in a long
        time. He was careful to walk a little way apart from the Dursleys so that
        Dudley and Piers, who were starting to get bored with the animals by lunchtime,
        wouldn''t fall back on their favorite hobby of hitting him. They ate in the
        zoo restaurant, and when Dudley had a tantrum because his knickerbocker glory
        didn''t have enough ice cream on top, Uncle Vernon bought him another one
        and Harry was allowed to finish the first. &lt;P&gt; Harry felt, afterward,
        that he should have known it was all too good to last. &lt;P&gt; After lunch
        they went to the reptile house. It was cool and dark in there, with lit windows
        all along the walls. Behind the glass, all sorts of lizards and snakes were
        crawling and slithering over bits of wood and stone. Dudley and Piers wanted
        to see huge, poisonous cobras and thick, man-crushing pythons. Dudley quickly
        found the largest snake in the place. It could have wrapped its body twice
        around Uncle Vernon''s car and crushed it into a trash can ? but at the moment
        it didn''t look in the mood. In fact, it was fast asleep. &lt;P&gt; Dudley
        stood with his nose pressed against the glass, staring at the glistening brown
        coils. &lt;P&gt; &quot;Make it move,&quot; he whined at his father. Uncle
        Vernon tapped on the glass, but the snake didn''t budge. &lt;P&gt; &quot;Do
        it again,&quot; Dudley ordered. Uncle Vernon rapped the glass smartly with
        his knuckles, but the snake just snoozed on. &lt;P&gt; &quot;This is boring,&quot;
        Dudley moaned. He shuffled away. &lt;P&gt; Harry moved in front of the tank
        and looked intently at the snake. He wouldn''t have been surprised if it had
        died of boredom itself ? no company except stupid people drumming their fingers
        on the glass trying to disturb it all day long. It was worse than having a
        cupboard as a bedroom, where the only visitor was Aunt Petunia hammering on
        the door to wake you up; at least he got to visit the rest of the house. &lt;P&gt;
        The snake suddenly opened its beady eyes. Slowly, very slowly, it raised its
        head until its eyes were on a level with Harry''s. &lt;P&gt; It winked. &lt;P&gt;
        Harry stared. Then he looked quickly around to see if anyone was watching.
        They weren''t. He looked back at the snake and winked, too. &lt;P&gt; The
        snake jerked its head toward Uncle Vernon and Dudley, then raised its eyes
        to the ceiling. It gave Harry a look that said quite plainly: &lt;P&gt; &quot;I
        get that all the time.&quot; &lt;P&gt; &quot;I know,&quot; Harry murmured
        through the glass, though he wasn''t sure the snake could hear him. &quot;It
        must be really annoying.&quot; &lt;P&gt; The snake nodded vigorously. &lt;P&gt;
        &quot;Where do you come from, anyway?&quot; Harry asked. &lt;P&gt; The snake
        jabbed its tail at a little sign next to the glass. Harry peered at it. &lt;P&gt;
        Boa Constrictor, Brazil. &lt;P&gt; &quot;Was it nice there?&quot; &lt;P&gt;
        The boa constrictor jabbed its tail at the sign again and Harry read on: This
        specimen was bred in the zoo. &quot;Oh, I see ? so you''ve never been to Brazil?&quot;
        &lt;P&gt; As the snake shook its head, a deafening shout behind Harry made
        both of them jump. &quot;DUDLEY! MR. DURSLEY! COME AND LOOK AT THIS SNAKE!
        YOU WON''T BELIEVE WHAT IT''S DOING!&quot; &lt;P&gt; Dudley came waddling
        toward them as fast as he could. &lt;P&gt; &quot;Out of the way, you,&quot;
        he said, punching Harry in the ribs. Caught by surprise, Harry fell hard on
        the concrete floor. What came next happened so fast no one saw how it happened
        ? one second, Piers and Dudley were leaning right up close to the glass, the
        next, they had leapt back with howls of horror. &lt;P&gt; Harry sat up and
        gasped; the glass front of the boa constrictor''s tank had vanished. The great
        snake was uncoiling itself rapidly, slithering out onto the floor. People
        throughout the reptile house screamed and started running for the exits. &lt;P&gt;
        As the snake slid swiftly past him, Harry could have sworn a low, hissing
        voice said, &quot;Brazil, here I come. . . . Thanksss, amigo.&quot; &lt;P&gt;
        The keeper of the reptile house was in shock. &lt;P&gt; &quot;But the glass,&quot;
        he kept saying, &quot;where did the glass go?&quot; &lt;P&gt; The zoo director
        himself made Aunt Petunia a cup of strong, sweet tea while he apologized over
        and over again. Piers and Dudley could only gibber. As far as Harry had seen,
        the snake hadn''t done anything except snap playfully at their heels as it
        passed, but by the time they were all back in Uncle Vernon''s car, Dudley
        was telling them how it had nearly bitten off his leg, while Piers was swearing
        it had tried to squeeze him to death. But worst of all, for Harry at least,
        was Piers calming down enough to say, &quot;Harry was talking to it, weren''t
        you, Harry?&quot; &lt;P&gt; Uncle Vernon waited until Piers was safely out
        of the house before starting on Harry. He was so angry he could hardly speak.
        He managed to say, &quot;Go ? cupboard ? stay ? no meals,&quot; before he
        collapsed into a chair, and Aunt Petunia had to run and get him a large brandy.
        Harry lay in his dark cupboard much later, wishing he had a watch. He didn''t
        know what time it was and he couldn''t be sure the Dursleys were asleep yet.
        Until they were, he couldn''t risk sneaking to the kitchen for some food.
        &lt;P&gt; He''d lived with the Dursleys almost ten years, ten miserable years,
        as long as he could remember, ever since he''d been a baby and his parents
        had died in that car crash. He couldn''t remember being in the car when his
        parents had died. Sometimes, when he strained his memory during long hours
        in his cupboard, he came up with a strange vision: a blinding flash of green
        light and a burning pain on his forehead. This, he supposed, was the crash,
        though he couldn''t imagine where all the green light came from. He couldn''t
        remember his parents at all. His aunt and uncle never spoke about them, and
        of course he was forbidden to ask questions. There were no photographs of
        them in the house. &lt;P&gt; When he had been younger, Harry had dreamed and
        dreamed of some unknown relation coming to take him away, but it had never
        happened; the Dursleys were his only family. Yet sometimes he thought (or
        maybe hoped) that strangers in the street seemed to know him. Very strange
        strangers they were, too. A tiny man in a violet top hat had bowed to him
        once while out shopping with Aunt Petunia and Dudley. After asking Harry furiously
        if he knew the man, Aunt Petunia had rushed them out of the shop without buying
        anything. A wild-looking old woman dressed all in green had waved merrily
        at him once on a bus. A bald man in a very long purple coat had actually shaken
        his hand in the street the other day and then walked away without a word.
        The weirdest thing about all these people was the way they seemed to vanish
        the second Harry tried to get a closer look. &lt;P&gt; At school, Harry had
        no one. Everybody knew that Dudley''s gang hated that odd Harry Potter in
        his baggy old clothes and broken glasses, and nobody liked to disagree with
        Dudley''s gang.","type":"Excerpt"}],"synopsis":[{"text":"Rescued from the

        Two &lt;br&gt;The Vanishing Glass&lt;/b&gt; &lt;P&gt;Nearly ten years had
        passed since the Dursleys had woken up to find their nephew on the front step,
        but Privet Drive had hardly changed at all. The sun rose on the same tidy
        front gardens and lit up the brass number four on the Dursleys'' front door;
        it crept into their living room, which was almost exactly the same as it had
        been on the night when Mr. Dursley had seen that fateful news report about
        the owls. Only the photographs on the mantelpiece really showed how much time
        had passed. Ten years ago, there had been lots of pictures of what looked
        like a large pink beach ball wearing different-colored bonnets ? but Dudley
        Dursley was no longer a baby, and now the photographs showed a large blond
        boy riding his first bicycle, on a carousel at the fair, playing a computer
        game with his father, being hugged and kissed by his mother. The room held
        no sign at all that another boy lived in the house, too. Yet Harry Potter
        was still there, asleep at the moment, but not for long. His Aunt Petunia
        was awake and it was her shrill voice that made the first noise of the day.
        &lt;P&gt; &quot;Up! Get up! Now!&quot; &lt;P&gt; Harry woke with a start.
        His aunt rapped on the door again. &lt;P&gt; &quot;Up!&quot; she screeched.
        Harry heard her walking toward the kitchen and then the sound of the frying
        pan being put on the stove. He rolled onto his back and tried to remember
        the dream he had been having. It had been a good one. There had been a flying
        motorcycle in it. He had a funny feeling he''d had the same dream before.
        &lt;P&gt; His aunt was back outside the door. &lt;P&gt; &quot;Are you up yet?&quot;
        she demanded. &lt;P&gt; &quot;Nearly,&quot; said Harry. &lt;P&gt; &quot;Well,
        get a move on, I want you to look after the bacon. And don''t you dare let
        it burn, I want everything perfect on Duddy''s birthday.&quot; &lt;P&gt; Harry
        groaned. &lt;P&gt; &quot;What did you say?&quot; his aunt snapped through
        the door. &lt;P&gt; &quot;Nothing, nothing . . .&quot; &lt;P&gt; Dudley''s
        birthday ? how could he have forgotten? Harry got slowly out of bed and started
        looking for socks. He found a pair under his bed and, after pulling a spider
        off one of them, put them on. Harry was used to spiders, because the cupboard
        under the stairs was full of them, and that was where he slept. &lt;P&gt;
        When he was dressed he went down the hall into the kitchen. The table was
        almost hidden beneath all Dudley''s birthday presents. It looked as though
        Dudley had gotten the new computer he wanted, not to mention the second television
        and the racing bike. Exactly why Dudley wanted a racing bike was a mystery
        to Harry, as Dudley was very fat and hated exercise ? unless of course it
        involved punching somebody. Dudley''s favorite punching bag was Harry, but
        he couldn''t often catch him. Harry didn''t look it, but he was very fast.
        &lt;P&gt; Perhaps it had something to do with living in a dark cupboard, but
        Harry had always been small and skinny for his age. He looked even smaller
        and skinnier than he really was because all he had to wear were old clothes
        of Dudley''s, and Dudley was about four times bigger than he was. Harry had
        a thin face, knobbly knees, black hair, and bright green eyes. He wore round
        glasses held together with a lot of Scotch tape because of all the times Dudley
        had punched him on the nose. The only thing Harry liked about his own appearance
        was a very thin scar on his forehead that was shaped like a bolt of lightning.
        He had had it as long as he could remember, and the first question he could
        ever remember asking his Aunt Petunia was how he had gotten it. &lt;P&gt;
        &quot;In the car crash when your parents died,&quot; she had said. &quot;And
        don''t ask questions.&quot; &lt;P&gt; Don''t ask questions ? that was the
        first rule for a quiet life with the Dursleys. &lt;P&gt; Uncle Vernon entered
        the kitchen as Harry was turning over the bacon. &lt;P&gt; &quot;Comb your
        hair!&quot; he barked, by way of a morning greeting. &lt;P&gt; About once
        a week, Uncle Vernon looked over the top of his newspaper and shouted that
        Harry needed a haircut. Harry must have had more haircuts than the rest of
        the boys in his class put together, but it made no difference, his hair simply
        grew that way ? all over the place. &lt;P&gt; Harry was frying eggs by the
        time Dudley arrived in the kitchen with his mother. Dudley looked a lot like
        Uncle Vernon. He had a large pink face, not much neck, small, watery blue
        eyes, and thick blond hair that lay smoothly on his thick, fat head. Aunt
        Petunia often said that Dudley looked like a baby angel ? Harry often said
        that Dudley looked like a pig in a wig. &lt;P&gt; Harry put the plates of
        egg and bacon on the table, which was difficult as there wasn''t much room.
        Dudley, meanwhile, was counting his presents. His face fell. &lt;P&gt; &quot;Thirty-six,&quot;
        he said, looking up at his mother and father. &quot;That''s two less than
        last year.&quot; &lt;P&gt; &quot;Darling, you haven''t counted Auntie Marge''s
        present, see, it''s here under this big one from Mommy and Daddy.&quot; &lt;P&gt;
        &quot;All right, thirty-seven then,&quot; said Dudley, going red in the face.
        Harry, who could see a huge Dudley tantrum coming on, began wolfing down his
        bacon as fast as possible in case Dudley turned the table over. &lt;P&gt;
        Aunt Petunia obviously scented danger, too, because she said quickly, &quot;And
        we''ll buy you another two presents while we''re out today. How''s that, popkin?
        Two more presents. Is that all right?&quot; &lt;P&gt; Dudley thought for a
        moment. It looked like hard work. Finally he said slowly, &quot;So I''ll have
        thirty . . . thirty . . .&quot; &lt;P&gt; &quot;Thirty-nine, sweetums,&quot;
        said Aunt Petunia. &lt;P&gt; &quot;Oh.&quot; Dudley sat down heavily and grabbed
        the nearest parcel. &quot;All right then.&quot; &lt;P&gt; Uncle Vernon chuckled.
        &lt;P&gt; &quot;Little tyke wants his money''s worth, just like his father.
        ''Atta boy, Dudley!&quot; He ruffled Dudley''s hair. &lt;P&gt; At that moment
        the telephone rang and Aunt Petunia went to answer it while Harry and Uncle
        Vernon watched Dudley unwrap the racing bike, a video camera, a remote control
        airplane, sixteen new computer games, and a VCR. He was ripping the paper
        off a gold wristwatch when Aunt Petunia came back from the telephone looking
        both angry and worried. &lt;P&gt; &quot;Bad news, Vernon,&quot; she said.
        &quot;Mrs. Figg''s broken her leg. She can''t take him.&quot; She jerked her
        head in Harry''s direction. &lt;P&gt; Dudley''s mouth fell open in horror,
        but Harry''s heart gave a leap. Every year on Dudley''s birthday, his parents
        took him and a friend out for the day, to adventure parks, hamburger restaurants,
        or the movies. Every year, Harry was left behind with Mrs. Figg, a mad old
        lady who lived two streets away. Harry hated it there. The whole house smelled
        of cabbage and Mrs. Figg made him look at photographs of all the cats she''d
        ever owned. &lt;P&gt; &quot;Now what?&quot; said Aunt Petunia, looking furiously
        at Harry as though he''d planned this. Harry knew he ought to feel sorry that
        Mrs. Figg had broken her leg, but it wasn''t easy when he reminded himself
        it would be a whole year before he had to look at Tibbles, Snowy, Mr. Paws,
        and Tufty again. &lt;P&gt; &quot;We could phone Marge,&quot; Uncle Vernon
        suggested. &lt;P&gt; &quot;Don''t be silly, Vernon, she hates the boy.&quot;
        &lt;P&gt; The Dursleys often spoke about Harry like this, as though he wasn''t
        there ? or rather, as though he was something very nasty that couldn''t understand
        them, like a slug. &lt;P&gt; &quot;What about what''s-her-name, your friend
        ? Yvonne?&quot; &lt;P&gt; &quot;On vacation in Majorca,&quot; snapped Aunt
        Petunia. &lt;P&gt; &quot;You could just leave me here,&quot; Harry put in
        hopefully (he''d be able to watch what he wanted on television for a change
        and maybe even have a go on Dudley''s computer). &lt;P&gt; Aunt Petunia looked
        as though she''d just swallowed a lemon. &lt;P&gt; &quot;And come back and
        find the house in ruins?&quot; she snarled. &lt;P&gt; &quot;I won''t blow
        up the house,&quot; said Harry, but they weren''t listening. &lt;P&gt; &quot;I
        suppose we could take him to the zoo,&quot; said Aunt Petunia slowly, &quot;.
        . . and leave him in the car. . . .&quot; &lt;P&gt; &quot;That car''s new,
        he''s not sitting in it alone. . . .&quot; &lt;P&gt; Dudley began to cry loudly.
        In fact, he wasn''t really crying ? it had been years since he''d really cried
        ? but he knew that if he screwed up his face and wailed, his mother would
        give him anything he wanted. &lt;P&gt; &quot;Dinky Duddydums, don''t cry,
        Mummy won''t let him spoil your special day!&quot; she cried, flinging her
        arms around him. &lt;P&gt; &quot;I . . . don''t . . . want . . . him . . .
        t-t-to come!&quot; Dudley yelled between huge, pretend sobs. &quot;He always
        sp-spoils everything!&quot; He shot Harry a nasty grin through the gap in
        his mother''s arms. &lt;P&gt; Just then, the doorbell rang ? &quot;Oh, good
        Lord, they''re here!&quot; said Aunt Petunia frantically ? and a moment later,
        Dudley''s best friend, Piers Polkiss, walked in with his mother. Piers was
        a scrawny boy with a face like a rat. He was usually the one who held people''s
        arms behind their backs while Dudley hit them. Dudley stopped pretending to
        cry at once. &lt;P&gt; Half an hour later, Harry, who couldn''t believe his
        luck, was sitting in the back of the Dursleys'' car with Piers and Dudley,
        on the way to the zoo for the first time in his life. His aunt and uncle hadn''t
        been able to think of anything else to do with him, but before they''d left,
        Uncle Vernon had taken Harry aside. &lt;P&gt; &quot;I''m warning you,&quot;
        he had said, putting his large purple face right up close to Harry''s, &quot;I''m
        warning you now, boy ? any funny business, anything at all ? and you''ll be
        in that cupboard from now until Christmas.&quot; &lt;P&gt; &quot;I''m not
        going to do anything,&quot; said Harry, &quot;honestly . . .&quot; &lt;P&gt;
        But Uncle Vernon didn''t believe him. No one ever did. &lt;P&gt; The problem
        was, strange things often happened around Harry and it was just no good telling
        the Dursleys he didn''t make them happen. &lt;P&gt; Once, Aunt Petunia, tired
        of Harry coming back from the barbers looking as though he hadn''t been at
        all, had taken a pair of kitchen scissors and cut his hair so short he was
        almost bald except for his bangs, which she left &quot;to hide that horrible
        scar.&quot; Dudley had laughed himself silly at Harry, who spent a sleepless
        night imagining school the next day, where he was already laughed at for his
        baggy clothes and taped glasses. Next morning, however, he had gotten up to
        find his hair exactly as it had been before Aunt Petunia had sheared it off.
        He had been given a week in his cupboard for this, even though he had tried
        to explain that he couldn''t explain how it had grown back so quickly. &lt;P&gt;
        Another time, Aunt Petunia had been trying to force him into a revolting old
        sweater of Dudley''s (brown with orange puff balls). The harder she tried
        to pull it over his head, the smaller it seemed to become, until finally it
        might have fitted a hand puppet, but certainly wouldn''t fit Harry. Aunt Petunia
        had decided it must have shrunk in the wash and, to his great relief, Harry
        wasn''t punished. &lt;P&gt; On the other hand, he''d gotten into terrible
        trouble for being found on the roof of the school kitchens. Dudley''s gang
        had been chasing him as usual when, as much to Harry''s surprise as anyone
        else''s, there he was sitting on the chimney. The Dursleys had received a
        very angry letter from Harry''s headmistress telling them Harry had been climbing
        school buildings. But all he''d tried to do (as he shouted at Uncle Vernon
        through the locked door of his cupboard) was jump behind the big trash cans
        outside the kitchen doors. Harry supposed that the wind must have caught him
        in mid-jump. &lt;P&gt; But today, nothing was going to go wrong. It was even
        worth being with Dudley and Piers to be spending the day somewhere that wasn''t
        school, his cupboard, or Mrs. Figg''s cabbage-smelling living room. &lt;P&gt;
        While he drove, Uncle Vernon complained to Aunt Petunia. He liked to complain
        about things: people at work, Harry, the council, Harry, the bank, and Harry
        were just a few of his favorite subjects. This morning, it was motorcycles.
        &lt;P&gt; &quot;. . . roaring along like maniacs, the young hoodlums,&quot;
        he said, as a motorcycle overtook them. &lt;P&gt; &quot;I had a dream about
        a motorcycle,&quot; said Harry, remembering suddenly. &quot;It was flying.&quot;
        &lt;P&gt; Uncle Vernon nearly crashed into the car in front. He turned right
        around in his seat and yelled at Harry, his face like a gigantic beet with
        a mustache: &quot;MOTORCYCLES DON''T FLY!&quot; &lt;P&gt; Dudley and Piers
        sniggered. &lt;P&gt; &quot;I know they don''t,&quot; said Harry. &quot;It
        was only a dream.&quot; &lt;P&gt; But he wished he hadn''t said anything.
        If there was one thing the Dursleys hated even more than his asking questions,
        it was his talking about anything acting in a way it shouldn''t, no matter
        if it was in a dream or even a cartoon ? they seemed to think he might get
        dangerous ideas. &lt;P&gt; It was a very sunny Saturday and the zoo was crowded
        with families. The Dursleys bought Dudley and Piers large chocolate ice creams
        at the entrance and then, because the smiling lady in the van had asked Harry
        what he wanted before they could hurry him away, they bought him a cheap lemon
        ice pop. It wasn''t bad, either, Harry thought, licking it as they watched
        a gorilla scratching its head who looked remarkably like Dudley, except that
        it wasn''t blond. &lt;P&gt; Harry had the best morning he''d had in a long
        time. He was careful to walk a little way apart from the Dursleys so that
        Dudley and Piers, who were starting to get bored with the animals by lunchtime,
        wouldn''t fall back on their favorite hobby of hitting him. They ate in the
        zoo restaurant, and when Dudley had a tantrum because his knickerbocker glory
        didn''t have enough ice cream on top, Uncle Vernon bought him another one
        and Harry was allowed to finish the first. &lt;P&gt; Harry felt, afterward,
        that he should have known it was all too good to last. &lt;P&gt; After lunch
        they went to the reptile house. It was cool and dark in there, with lit windows
        all along the walls. Behind the glass, all sorts of lizards and snakes were
        crawling and slithering over bits of wood and stone. Dudley and Piers wanted
        to see huge, poisonous cobras and thick, man-crushing pythons. Dudley quickly
        found the largest snake in the place. It could have wrapped its body twice
        around Uncle Vernon''s car and crushed it into a trash can ? but at the moment
        it didn''t look in the mood. In fact, it was fast asleep. &lt;P&gt; Dudley
        stood with his nose pressed against the glass, staring at the glistening brown
        coils. &lt;P&gt; &quot;Make it move,&quot; he whined at his father. Uncle
        Vernon tapped on the glass, but the snake didn''t budge. &lt;P&gt; &quot;Do
        it again,&quot; Dudley ordered. Uncle Vernon rapped the glass smartly with
        his knuckles, but the snake just snoozed on. &lt;P&gt; &quot;This is boring,&quot;
        Dudley moaned. He shuffled away. &lt;P&gt; Harry moved in front of the tank
        and looked intently at the snake. He wouldn''t have been surprised if it had
        died of boredom itself ? no company except stupid people drumming their fingers
        on the glass trying to disturb it all day long. It was worse than having a
        cupboard as a bedroom, where the only visitor was Aunt Petunia hammering on
        the door to wake you up; at least he got to visit the rest of the house. &lt;P&gt;
        The snake suddenly opened its beady eyes. Slowly, very slowly, it raised its
        head until its eyes were on a level with Harry''s. &lt;P&gt; It winked. &lt;P&gt;
        Harry stared. Then he looked quickly around to see if anyone was watching.
        They weren''t. He looked back at the snake and winked, too. &lt;P&gt; The
        snake jerked its head toward Uncle Vernon and Dudley, then raised its eyes
        to the ceiling. It gave Harry a look that said quite plainly: &lt;P&gt; &quot;I
        get that all the time.&quot; &lt;P&gt; &quot;I know,&quot; Harry murmured
        through the glass, though he wasn''t sure the snake could hear him. &quot;It
        must be really annoying.&quot; &lt;P&gt; The snake nodded vigorously. &lt;P&gt;
        &quot;Where do you come from, anyway?&quot; Harry asked. &lt;P&gt; The snake
        jabbed its tail at a little sign next to the glass. Harry peered at it. &lt;P&gt;
        Boa Constrictor, Brazil. &lt;P&gt; &quot;Was it nice there?&quot; &lt;P&gt;
        The boa constrictor jabbed its tail at the sign again and Harry read on: This
        specimen was bred in the zoo. &quot;Oh, I see ? so you''ve never been to Brazil?&quot;
        &lt;P&gt; As the snake shook its head, a deafening shout behind Harry made
        both of them jump. &quot;DUDLEY! MR. DURSLEY! COME AND LOOK AT THIS SNAKE!
        YOU WON''T BELIEVE WHAT IT''S DOING!&quot; &lt;P&gt; Dudley came waddling
        toward them as fast as he could. &lt;P&gt; &quot;Out of the way, you,&quot;
        he said, punching Harry in the ribs. Caught by surprise, Harry fell hard on
        the concrete floor. What came next happened so fast no one saw how it happened
        ? one second, Piers and Dudley were leaning right up close to the glass, the
        next, they had leapt back with howls of horror. &lt;P&gt; Harry sat up and
        gasped; the glass front of the boa constrictor''s tank had vanished. The great
        snake was uncoiling itself rapidly, slithering out onto the floor. People
        throughout the reptile house screamed and started running for the exits. &lt;P&gt;
        As the snake slid swiftly past him, Harry could have sworn a low, hissing
        voice said, &quot;Brazil, here I come. . . . Thanksss, amigo.&quot; &lt;P&gt;
        The keeper of the reptile house was in shock. &lt;P&gt; &quot;But the glass,&quot;
        he kept saying, &quot;where did the glass go?&quot; &lt;P&gt; The zoo director
        himself made Aunt Petunia a cup of strong, sweet tea while he apologized over
        and over again. Piers and Dudley could only gibber. As far as Harry had seen,
        the snake hadn''t done anything except snap playfully at their heels as it
        passed, but by the time they were all back in Uncle Vernon''s car, Dudley
        was telling them how it had nearly bitten off his leg, while Piers was swearing
        it had tried to squeeze him to death. But worst of all, for Harry at least,
        was Piers calming down enough to say, &quot;Harry was talking to it, weren''t
        you, Harry?&quot; &lt;P&gt; Uncle Vernon waited until Piers was safely out
        of the house before starting on Harry. He was so angry he could hardly speak.
        He managed to say, &quot;Go ? cupboard ? stay ? no meals,&quot; before he
        collapsed into a chair, and Aunt Petunia had to run and get him a large brandy.
        Harry lay in his dark cupboard much later, wishing he had a watch. He didn''t
        know what time it was and he couldn''t be sure the Dursleys were asleep yet.
        Until they were, he couldn''t risk sneaking to the kitchen for some food.
        &lt;P&gt; He''d lived with the Dursleys almost ten years, ten miserable years,
        as long as he could remember, ever since he''d been a baby and his parents
        had died in that car crash. He couldn''t remember being in the car when his
        parents had died. Sometimes, when he strained his memory during long hours
        in his cupboard, he came up with a strange vision: a blinding flash of green
        light and a burning pain on his forehead. This, he supposed, was the crash,
        though he couldn''t imagine where all the green light came from. He couldn''t
        remember his parents at all. His aunt and uncle never spoke about them, and
        of course he was forbidden to ask questions. There were no photographs of
        them in the house. &lt;P&gt; When he had been younger, Harry had dreamed and
        dreamed of some unknown relation coming to take him away, but it had never
        happened; the Dursleys were his only family. Yet sometimes he thought (or
        maybe hoped) that strangers in the street seemed to know him. Very strange
        strangers they were, too. A tiny man in a violet top hat had bowed to him
        once while out shopping with Aunt Petunia and Dudley. After asking Harry furiously
        if he knew the man, Aunt Petunia had rushed them out of the shop without buying
        anything. A wild-looking old woman dressed all in green had waved merrily
        at him once on a bus. A bald man in a very long purple coat had actually shaken
        his hand in the street the other day and then walked away without a word.
        The weirdest thing about all these people was the way they seemed to vanish
        the second Harry tried to get a closer look. &lt;P&gt; At school, Harry had
        no one. Everybody knew that Dudley''s gang hated that odd Harry Potter in
        his baggy old clothes and broken glasses, and nobody liked to disagree with
        Dudley''s gang.","type":"Excerpt"}],"synopsis":[{"text":"Rescued from the
